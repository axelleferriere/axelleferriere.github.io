Welcome to my website! I'm an Assistant Professor at [PSE](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/) and a Research Fellow at the [CNRS](https://cnrs.fr/en/). I'm also a Research Affiliate at the [CEPR](https://cepr.org/). 

My research focuses on macroeconomics and heterogeneity, with emphasis on fiscal policy.
