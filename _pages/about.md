Welcome to my website! I'm an associate professor at [Sciences Po](https://www.sciencespo.fr/department-economics/) and a research fellow at the [CNRS](https://cnrs.fr/en/). I'm also a research affiliate at the [CEPR](https://cepr.org/). 

My research focuses on macroeconomics and heterogeneity, with emphasis on fiscal policy.
